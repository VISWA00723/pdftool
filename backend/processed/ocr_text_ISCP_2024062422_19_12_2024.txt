2.0 OBJECTIVE:

ISRO is embarking on a mission to produce large number of satellites to be put in
orbit in the next five years and is all set to realize 15 to 20spacecraft per year. This
calls for a large number of electronic sub-systems to be fabricated, tested and made
ready for integration. In order to meet the growing demand of high power satellites, it
becomes imperative to realise a high power& high voltage power bus capable of
handling output power of 10- 20 kW. A high voltage (100V), high power, modular and
optimized power package for I-6k satellite platforms has been envisaged and
proposed in this document.

U.R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) is currently developing Integrated Modular Power
Packages (IMPP) for 100V Bus. For the realisation of IMPP, URSC is looking for the
support of Indian industry with strong engineering, design and analysis background
for the delivery of 3 sets of Engineering Model (EM) hardware.

3.0 SCOPE OF WORK:

URSC invites application for Expression of Interest (Eol) with a detailed proposal
along with proof of vendor expertise to develop EM of IMPP for 100V power bus.
After successful demonstration of first EM, subsequent EMs(2Nos) shall be realised,
tested and delivered by incorporating the suggestions/observations made during first
EM model evaluation. This document provides the basic information needed for
expression of Interest related to IMPP for 100V bus. It further specifies vendor
selection criteria, Eol proposal, indent process, design details, list of activities to be
carried out and the responsibility of vendor and URSC in executing this work.

The activities to be carried out by the vendor for the realisation of IMPP are the
following

e Mechanical housing design and analysis using aluminum alloy (AAG061) for
20kW of output power and realization for 10kW.

e PCB layout design for the circuit schematic provided

e Verification of PCB design using appropriate software tools.

e EEE component procurement and storage

e Special test equipment procurement

e PCB fabrication

e SMT and through hole fabrication

e Testing of cards and packages as per the specifications

e Tuning of design to meet the specifications

e Assembly of all the individual modules to form IMPP

e Environmental testing at module and integrated levelas per the test levels
provided


--- Page 14 ---
e Final Integrated bench testing of IMPP as per the specification

This hardware is planned to be realized through qualified vendors who are familiar
and have experience in aero space electronic hardware realization and who own
necessary infrastructure for fabrication, testing, simulation/analysis and experience

of handling high reliability (HIREL) EEE components.

4.0 INTRODUCTION TO INTEGRATED MODULAR POWER

13.1 Name of Design: Power Module (PM)

a. Brief Description/functionality of module:

The Power Module (PM) is responsible for processing power from battery as well as
solar array. The PM is modular in nature to meet the different load power
requirements of various spacecraft configuration. Each PM can process around 1.25
kW of battery power and 2 kW of solar array power with 100V as the output. The
battery power processing is done through a DC-DC converter whereas the solar
array power is processed using a shunt regulator.

Fig. 1.5 Block diagram — Power Module
c. Powering scheme:

PM receives bias supplies such as +14.7V, -14.7V, 5.7V & +12.7V from the domestic
regulator for powering all the ICs present in PM and driving of MOSFETs. Two chain
of bias supplies are required for redundancy purpose. Two hot redundant domestic
regulators are used for providing two chains of bias supplies through back plane
interfaces. No sequencing is required among the bias supplies and all are expected
to be available at PM at the same time.

d. Grounding scheme:

Power module processes the battery power as well as solar array power. The power
ground is isolated in the module from the bias supply ground. Since Distributed

26


--- Page 32 ---
Single Point Grounding Scheme (DSPG) is followed, the bias grounds will get
connected to the chassis of the module. +12.7V bias supply return will be connected

to bus negative due to +12.7V utilisation in the circuit.

e. Power handling and dissipation:

Power Module handles 1250W of battery power and 2000W of solar array power.

The module should able to handle maximum power dissipation of 45W.

f. No of modules:

For the planned 3 EM models of PCU for handling 10KW of output power, 8 power
modules are required (with one module as redundant) to process the battery power.
These modules are modular in nature and share the total power among themselves.

13.2. Name of Design: Bus Capacitor

a. Brief Description/functionality of module:

The power bus provided to the user should have low impedance at the source. This
low impedance of the bus is achieved by having sufficient low ESR capacitors.
Capacitor bank is designed to do exactly the same job. The complete capacitor bank
consist of 2 capacitor cards. Spacecraft is made ON using bus simulator concept.
The interface of bus simulator to spacecraft power bus is housed along with the
capacitor bank. The Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) requires bus voltage as
feedback and powering the Domestic regulators. Fused bus voltage signal for these
requirements are provided with this card.

c. Powering scheme:

The capacitor card doesn’t contain any circuit which requires any biasing. Powering
this card is via bus simulator input or directly connecting across the bus.

d. Grounding scheme:

30


--- Page 36 ---
Since this PCB doesn’t contain any circuit which requires any biasing, it doesn’t
require any signal grounding scheme. The bus return present in the card is
connected to bus bar return and doesn’t require any grounding with respect to

chassis.

e. Power handling and dissipation:

Since this PCB hold the capacitor bank for the bus, it doesn’t require any
specification related to power handling. All the power handled by this module are
transient in nature. The PCB should be designed to handle power dissipation of the
order of 2W. The bus simulator interface which interface the PCU with ground
equipment shall dissipate a power of 8W. This power dissipation is only during

ground operation and not during mission or inflight.

f. No of modules:

13.3. Name of Design: Majority Voting Logic Card (MVL)

a. Brief Description/functionality of module:

The Battery Discharge Regulator (BDR) & Solar Array Regulator (SAR) regulates the
bus voltage to a set point through a closed loop system. The voltage feedback for
both BDR & SAR becomes very crucial for to achieve fully regulated power bus. For
this reason the voltage feedback system is generated by a majority voting logic
(MVL) circuit. Along with the two MVL circuits, one each for BDR & SAR, MVL card
contains power bus voltage telemetry circuits and bus over voltage detection and
control signal generation circuit for external loads.

b. Block diagram:
The block diagram of MVL card is shown in Fig. 1.7

c. Powering scheme: MVL receives bias supplies such as +14.7V & -14.7V
from the domestic regulator for powering all the |Cs. Two chain of bias supplies are
required for redundancy purpose. Two hot redundant domestic regulators are used
for providing two chain of bias supplies through back plane interfaces. No
sequencing is required among the bias supplies and all are expected to available at
MVL card at the same time.

d. Grounding scheme:

MVL card receives fused bus voltage for sensing purpose. These signals are
referred to the signal ground rather than the power ground. Two grounding plane is
required in this board to have isolation between BDR MVL and SAR MVL. BDR MVL
circuit is connected to a ground plane which has provision to get either referred to
signal ground in the PCB or to power ground through the interfacing connector. All
the remaining circuits in the PCB are referred to the signal ground and can have
connection with chassis of the package. This grounding follows the DSPG scheme.

e. Power handling and dissipation:

The electronics present in this board are for analog signal processing. The PCB
should be designed to take care of heat dissipation of 3W.

f. No of modules: Single MVL is planned for PCU.

Table 1.29: Design details — Battery Charge regulator
Details for SI. No. 2 . DESCRIPTION OF THE HARDWARE:

The battery charge regulator (BCR) is designed to charge Li-lon battery directly from
100V BUS. BCR, which is essentially a non-isolated buck (step down) dc-dc
converter, is designed to charge a lower voltage battery from a higher voltage bus. It
is capable of charging battery with CC-CV as shown in Figure 2. It can charge Li-lon
battery with regulated constant current until End of Charge (EOC) voltage is
reached. These current and EOC voltage set points can be selected using 16-bit
tele-command to 256 different levels each. It can be switched ON/OFF by tele-

command and has in-built over-current protection and FPGA interface for over-
voltage protection.

Remarks
Domreg Over Voltage Protection (DROVP) PCB

DROVP PCB is having over voltage protection
feature for all five outputs of Domreg. In case of
overvoltage in one Domestic regulator (Main or
redundant), the output supply of that particular
chain will turn OFF and disable the OVP protection
of other chain.
This PCB is having following features:

1. Current telemetry circuit (for both main &

redundant converter)
2. Analog voltage telemetry of output voltages.
3. OVP status of each Domestic regulator.
